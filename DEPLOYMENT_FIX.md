# Deployment Fix Documentation

## Issue Resolved
The deployment was failing with the error:
```
error TS5083: Cannot read file '/var/www/html/tsconfig.json'.
```

## Root Cause
The TypeScript compiler was looking for `tsconfig.json` in the wrong directory (`/var/www/html/`) instead of the project directory. This was caused by:
1. Working directory issues in the deployment script
2. Path resolution problems during the build process

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `deploy.sh`
- Added explicit directory verification
- Added fallback to robust build script
- Improved error handling and logging

### 2. Created `build-robust.sh`
- Standalone build script with comprehensive verification
- Ensures correct working directory
- Step-by-step build process with detailed logging
- Verification of all required files before building

### 3. Updated `package.json`
- Added `build:robust` script for easy access
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing scripts

## Usage

### Option 1: Use the updated deploy script
```bash
./deploy.sh --build-only
```

### Option 2: Use the robust build script directly
```bash
./build-robust.sh
```

### Option 3: Use npm script
```bash
npm run build:robust
```

## Key Features of the Fix

1. **Directory Verification**: Ensures the script runs from the correct project directory
2. **File Existence Checks**: Verifies all required files (package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts) exist
3. **Step-by-step Process**: Clear logging for each build step
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and exit codes
5. **Fallback Support**: Multiple build methods for reliability

## Build Process Steps

1. **Directory Verification**: Check current directory and required files
2. **Clean Build**: Remove previous build artifacts
3. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm ci` for clean dependency installation
4. **TypeScript Compilation**: Run `npx tsc -b` with verbose output
5. **Vite Build**: Run `npx vite build --mode production`
6. **Verification**: Check build output exists and is valid

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Working Directory**: Ensure you're in `/home/sasikalavijayakumar/pragathi_server/PRAGATHI-UI`
2. **Verify Files**: Ensure `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, and `vite.config.ts` exist
3. **Check Node Version**: Ensure Node.js 20+ is available
4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the script has execute permissions (`chmod +x`)

## Success Indicators

- Build completes without TypeScript path errors
- All build steps show "successful" status
- `dist/` directory is created with build artifacts
- No critical errors in the build output

The deployment process is now robust and should work consistently across different environments.
